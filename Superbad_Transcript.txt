SUPER BAD
1 OPENING CREDITS OVER SUPER-FUNKY BLAXPLOITATION-STYLE MUSIC, 1
which builds to an exciting crescendo filling us with the
expectation of a thrilling, action-packed opening sequence.
Instead we get:
INT. SETH’S CAR - MORNING
Seth, seventeen, a bit heavyset, in the midst of a sad
attempt at growing a goatee and clearly a terrible driver,
cruises along while fiddling with the CD player. He pulls out
his cell and dials.
SETH
Yo.
INTERCUT WITH:
2 INT. EVAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 2
Evan, seventeen, a little too tall and slim, a boy who
clearly never figured out how to style his hair, is finishing
off a bowl of cereal. He is on his cell phone.
EVAN
What’s up?
SETH
I was doing research last night, for next
year, and I think I’m gonna go with Bang
Bus.
EVAN
Which one’s Bang Bus?
SETH
The one where they bang the chicks on the
bus. Thirteen bucks a month. Total
access, live Web Cam feed. The works.
It’ll be like I’m on the bus, banging
them myself.
EVAN
That stuff’s bullshit, they’re all faking
it. And plus, your parents are gonna look
at the bill.
SETH
It shows up under a different name.
(beat)
I hope. Bang Bus.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
That wouldn’t look good. Maybe I should
just pick the one with the least dirty
sounding name.
EVAN
Weapons of Ass Destruction’s out then.
Seth pulls up in front of a house.
SETH
I could tell my parents I’m doing a
project on Rome and I have to research
orgies.
3 EXT. EVAN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 3
Evan walks out his front door. WE REVEAL he is walking
towards Seth’s car.
EVAN
(still into phone)
Yeah. Just tell them your taking a class
on blow jobs.
They both hang up and Evan gets in the car. Seth is about to
pull away, when EVAN’S MOTHER comes out the front door.
EVAN’S MOM
Thanks for taking him, Seth.
Evan changes the radio station. Seth slaps his hand.
SETH
Don’t touch that!
EVAN’S MOM
You two are so funny. I can’t imagine
what you’ll do without each other next
year. Evan told me you didn’t get into
State.
SETH
Yeah, you know. I got some other places.
Good places. I think we’ll be fine.
EVAN’S MOM
Are you going to miss each other?
EVAN
Miss each other? No!
2.
2 CONTINUED: 2
SETH (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
SETH
That’s disgusting.
MOM
Bye, boys.
Seth and Evan drive off.
SETH
I am truly, truly jealous that you got to
suck on those tits when you were a baby.
EVAN
Fuck you, man.
4 EXT. CLARK SECONDARY- SOON AFTER 4
They drive up to Clark Secondary. There is a giant sign that
reads “Seniors - Two Glorious Weeks Until Graduation”. Seth
turns into the STAFF parking lot.
5 INT/EXT. 7-11 STORE - MOMENTS LATER 5
Seth and Evan walk past a group of smokers, towards the 7-11.
EVAN
You’re being an idiot, man. You really
shouldn’t park there.
SETH
Fuck it. I’m a senior about to graduate.
They should be suckin’ my balls. It’s the
least they can do for stealing three
years of my life.
They walk past DIMITRI (18, big Native American guy) as they
enter the store. Dimitri aggressively bumps his shoulder into
Seth.
EVAN
What the hell’s wrong with Dimitri?
SETH
Oh, yeah dude, I forgot to tell you. I
knocked the fuckin’ shit out of him in
capture the flag last week.
EVAN
Good! 9th Grade Camp he gave me whiplash
in “King of the Ring.” I fucking hate
that guy.
They go to the magazine rack and stare at a Maxim cover.
3.
3 CONTINUED: 3
(CONTINUED)
EVAN (CONT’D)
Look at those nipples.
SETH
They’re like baby toes.
EVAN
It’s not fair. I have to hide every
erection I get.
SETH
Sometimes I get boners so big I can’t
hide them. And then I get nervous and my
heart starts pounding, and it all just,
like, feeds my boner. It just becomes
this...thing...that’s attached to me. And
it won’t go away.
EVAN
Just imagine if girls weren’t weirded out
by our boners and they actually wanted to
see ‘em, like this shit.
SETH
You know it’s been, like, a year and a
half since I’ve seen an actual human
female nipple. Besides my mom’s. I saw it
last month, and it was sick.
EVAN
Holy shit. Liat was two years ago? I
guess so. She was insanely hot, though.
SETH
Exactly. Too hot. That’s what sucks.
EVAN
How can that possibly suck? I’d be
fuckin’ psyched if I’d gotten with a girl
that hot. You got, like, two dozen
handjobs!
SETH
And three quarters of a blowjob, But that
was fuckin’ it. It was the peak of my assgettin’ career, and it happened way, way,
way too early.
EVAN
You’re like Orson Welles.
